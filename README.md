# Questionable

A simple game to play with a group of friends, inspired by a game mode from Jackbox Party Pack.

Every round, all players are asked a question, with one person being asked a slightly different question. When the timer is up, players' answers are displayed, based on which everyone gets to vote on who they think got the different question.
The goal of the one player is to reach the end of the game undetected; the goal of everyone else is to oust the impostor.
